# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It involves comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation to identify key factors contributing to churn and predict customer behavior.

## Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- keras
- pytorch

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`).
2. Place the `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` dataset in the same directory as the `Untitled7.ipynb` notebook.
3. Open the `Untitled7.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Google Colab).
4. Run all cells in the notebook to perform data analysis and visualization and model training and predict data.
